        <ion-card-title>What is MiHome?</ion-card-title>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
          MiHome is an open source environmental sensor.
          It was designed to provide students and researchers a cheap and reliable platform to collect
          information about their homes, offices, classrooms, or anywhere else they may need to study. 
          Users of MiHome have the options of building on top of the Particle IoT platform, or they can 
          build their own with Arduinos.

              The Particle IoT platform is an easy way of to be introduced to the world of <em>IoT</em>, or "Internet of Things". 
              It's simple: connect one of your interent able devices into an array of sensors and/or hardware. 
              After prrogramming some firmware with Particle's online IDE, you will have successfully launched an IoT device.
              This approach is one of the ways MiHome supplies fast and reliable data to its users. 
              The most recent version of the MiHome system does not actually use the Particle IoT platform, but rather it uses the 
              ESP8266 Wifi module which is Arduino compatible. Within this setup, the Hub 
              contains the ESP8266 Wifi module and a 915MHz radio transceiver and the 
              nodes contains all the sensor equipment which is packaged with an Arduino Nano and 
              the same 915MHz radio transceivers.

                MiHome was created using Apache Cordova and Ionic 2 in order to create a cross-platform
                mobile app. Functionally MiHome takes place inside of a webview which allows the pages to
                be written using HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript.
